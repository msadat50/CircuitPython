## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
This is the code for circuit python.

```python
import board
import neopixel
import sleep

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
dot.brightness = 0.5 

print("Make it red!")

while True:
    dot.fill((0, 0, 255))
    time.sleep
    print("Make it yellow!")
    dot.fill((51, 204, 51))
    time.sleep
    

```


### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here

### Images
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Reflection
Doing this was easy. The only promble was that I had the code written but when I was trying to uploaded it wasn't working like the light was changing, but one of my classmate help me out. The promble was that I had to uploade something in my folder first after doing that it worked. 




## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code
This is the code for making a servo trun. 
```python
# Write your code here :-)
import board
import pwmio
import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
    for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.05)
```

### Evidence
This is the websites that I used to get the code for my servo.

### Reflection
Doing this was easy. I had one wiring putting in the wrong place, which was the A0 Thanks to Mr. H he helped me correct it and he help me put the code into the in github.
