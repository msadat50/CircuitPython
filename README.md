## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
This is the code for circuit python.

```python
import board
import neopixel
import sleep

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
dot.brightness = 0.5 

print("Make it red!")

while True:
    dot.fill((0, 0, 255))
    time.sleep
    print("Make it yellow!")
    dot.fill((51, 204, 51))
    time.sleep
    

```


### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here

### Images
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Reflection
Doing this was easy the only promble was that I had the code written but when I was trying to uploaded it wasn't working like the light was changing, but one of my classmate help me out. The promble was that I had to uploade something in my folder first after doing that it worked.
